# 🧠 Touch Typing Practice Program (Python)

## Description

A simple terminal-based touch typing practice tool built with Python. This program helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy by displaying random everyday English words for them to type. It tracks performance in real-time, including typing speed (WPM) and error count.

## 📝 Steps to Customize:
Open words.txt
Locate the words.txt file in the project folder. It contains the words used during the typing practice.

Edit the File
Replace the existing words or add your own. Make sure:

Each word is on a new line.

No punctuation or numbers (unless you want to practice those too).

## 🛠️ Python libraries Used

- **Tkinter**: standard python interface.
- **time**: to count the time when typing (wpm calculation).
- **random**: to shuffle the words.
